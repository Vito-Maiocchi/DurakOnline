Thomas questions:

-   Right now if the client defending picks up the cards, the attacker and co-attacker can not throw in any more cards.
    -   Should the attacker and co-attacker be able to throw in cards after the defender picks up the cards?
        or should the attacker and co-attacker need to press ready and only then the defender can pick up the cards?


server.cpp:
- clean up the code
- add the same changes as in test_server2.cpp

msg_handler.cpp:

- check the logic of ClientActionEvent
- check the logic of PlayCardEvent msg
- find a way to deal with ClientDisconnectEvent

game.cpp:
- createBattle() function
- isStarted() function
- endGame() function
- resetGame() function
- updateTurnOrder() function

- send GameStateUpdate messages
- send PlayerUpdate messages 
  
- test all functions with google tests in Test/test_game.cpp, use `ctest` to run
  


battle.cpp:
- test all functions with google tests in Test/test_battle.cpp, use `ctest` to run
- send BattleStateUpdate messages after move turn (1)
- send AvailableActionUpdate in handleActionEvent (2 - 3)
- send IllegalMoveNotify messages (2)
  
- function: handleClientActionEvent() needs to be checked and improved
  
- check logic and clean up code
  
- implement a data structure that will save the whoever attacked first

- send CardUpdate messages
- test all functions with google tests
- determine trump function should also take the trump card and send a message to the client to render it
